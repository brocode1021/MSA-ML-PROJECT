# MSA-ML-PROJECT
This task is designed to test your ability to build a simple Machine Learning model. You can choose a Regression or Classification problem using standard beginner-friendly datasets. Your focus should be on understanding the ML pipeline: data → preprocessing → model → results.
Number Guessing Game
Hey... This is a fun little number guessing game I made with Python.
The computer thinks of a secret number between 1 and 100, and you get 7 tries to guess what it is. It's simple, fun, and a new puzzle every time you play.
How It Works
When you start a game, the computer secretly picks a random number. It'll then ask for your guess and give you a helpful hint after each try, telling you if your guess was too high or too low.
You keep guessing until you either get it right or you run out of your 7 tries. Simple as that!
Oh, and if you accidentally type letters instead of a number, the game will just ask you to try again without breaking.
Game Results
When the game ends, you'll see one of two messages:
If you win:
The secret number was indeed 58
And it took you 4 tries.
If you run out of tries:
You've run out of tries.
The secret number was 72.
How to Play
Ready to give it a go? You don't need to install anything special, just have Python on your computer.
Save the code in a file named game.py.
Open your terminal (like Command Prompt or Terminal).
Navigate to the folder where you saved the file.
Run the command: python game.py
